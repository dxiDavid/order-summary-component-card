### Overview

This card was fairly simple to implement since it did not need to have different views for different breakpoints. It was also a good way to practice my layout skills for something simple. I enjoyed styling this card and I'm happy with how it turned out.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS


### What I learned

I learned to use responsive units like em and rem instead of absolute values like pixels. They make the card rersponsive adapt to a user's
preferences for things like font size while maintaining the general proportions.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This is where I found the best tutorials and explanations (For me) on CSS concepts and      writing functional CSS. This guy really knows his stuff and gives concise explanations.

- [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) - This website has an entire course on CSS with simple examples for both basic and advanced concepts.
